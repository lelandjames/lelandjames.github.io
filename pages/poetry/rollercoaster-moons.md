    <h2>ROLLERCOASTER MOONS</h2>
    <p><em>The Rollercoaster Moons</em> (Little Red Tree Publishing) lives up to its title, offering a satisfying sometimes electrifying ride. Approximately half the book is in traditional meter and often rhyme, with a contemporary feel. The remainder of the poems have their own alternative metrical scheme and structure, always musical. Sections of the book range from the whimsical to the deeply reflective, over a wide variety of universal themes. Subjects and ideas are often approached from different angles both within and in different poems. James is not afraid of deep sadness, laughter, or joy. His poetry is deeply rooted in the traditions of the past, with a modern tone, syntax, and diction. His book honors the poetry traditions of the past, while not being afraid to bend and stretch the poetry medium to create sharp turns and sudden changes in direction. A deeply satisfying ride for readers of all ages and differing poetic inclinations. <strong>—Amazon</strong></p>
    <p>“James, in <em>Rollercoaster Moons</em>, employs an imagination and spontaneous quality of language.”</p><p><strong>—Dr. Karunesh Kumar Agarwal, Editor Cyberwit.net</strong></p>
