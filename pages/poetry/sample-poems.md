<h3><strong>Rendering Ruins</strong></h3>
<p>A barn abandoned, left to drift alone,</p>
<p>wind torn and breached upon the reef of time;</p>
<p>fields, now dust, where summer wheat was sewn,</p>
<p>the wagons heaped with grain stood long in line</p>
<p>to fill the grange of this once mighty ship,</p>
<p>now but a shadow, listing, ghostly gray.</p>
<p>Raw winds and pelts of rain how cruelly whip</p>
<p>the wounded roof and soak the rotted hay</p>
<p>--the roof, an April green in days before,</p>
<p>a farmer's name upon it stitched in white.</p>
<p>This ark of kittens, bawling calves, no more.</p>
<p>A rat gnaws on a crib, the final rite.</p>
<p>Yet on this easel, raised by bardic hand,</p>
<p>forgotten barns, <em>forgotten not</em>, still stand.</p>

<h3><strong>Butch the Mercurial Cat</strong></h3>
<p>The cat, a tabby gray,</p>
<p>his coat a watered silk,</p>
<p>long whiskers, yellow eyed.</p>
<p>Oh! how that cat loves milk.</p>
<p>A boy gives Butch his milk</p>
<p>inside a castoff pipe,</p>
<p>the pipe a whisker small</p>
<p>for Butch the milk to swipe.</p>
<p>Yet, thirsty tabby slides</p>
<p>into the narrow way,</p>
<p>a curling wisp of smoke,</p>
<p>a curlicue of gray.</p>
<p>Like brother Cheshire Cat,</p>
<p>Butch has his bag of tricks,</p>
<p>a little magic act</p>
<p>that he does just for kicks.</p>
<p>The boy lies on the ground;</p>
<p>into the pipe he spies.</p>
<p>Somehow!</p>
<p>Butch has turned around:</p>
<p>a pair of yellow eyes!</p>
<p>A float of tabby tail,</p>
<p>then into thinnest air,</p>
<p>without the slightest sound,</p>
<p>Butch isn't there!</p>

<h3><strong>Spirit Road</strong></h3>
<p><em>Above the 49<sup>th</sup> parallel:</em></p>
<p>The trace of an old wagon road</p>
<p>--like faded tracks in snow</p>
<p>or a man's passage through tall grass</p>
<p>an hour before--a phantom trail,</p>
<p>twists and turns through maple and beech,</p>
<p>around steep hills of pine, winding deep,</p>
<p>deep into the age-old wood,</p>
<p>the way of a wounded deer fleeing the pack</p>
<p>or a wisp of smoke from a dying fire.</p>
<p>Wild leeks in the air, the complaint of a crow,</p>
<p>the crackle and hum of a hornets' nest.</p>
<p>Winter's breath, faint as the smell of wild grapes,</p>
<p>yet there, always there in this high place</p>
<p>far north of paved roads and gathering places.</p>
<p>Small signs: the ghost of a wooden wheel</p>
<p>long baked in mud grown brittle,</p>
<p>a nail, a doll, naked, blind breasts, faceless,</p>
<p>a tree bent back, lodged behind another,</p>
<p>grown strange like a humpbacked man.</p>
<p>A dozen partridges, the color of brush,</p>
<p>completely without fear, move aside, disappear.</p>
<p>A clearing: trees felled, trimmed, stacked in rows.</p>
<p>An ax, the handle rotted to dust, the head red with rust,</p>
<p>lying where it fell, having let go slowly over the years,</p>
<p>falling from the stump where it was left embedded,</p>
<p>losing faith in the hands that would lift it</p>
<p>and finish the temple, hands that never returned.</p>
<p>The cry of a loon on a distant lake.</p>
<p>A yellow leaf falls lazily down,</p>
<p>riding complex currents of sun and wind;</p>
<p>the forest sighs, a nearly inaudible sigh</p>
<p>--north, a far place north, north of the 49<sup>th</sup> parallel,</p>
<p>where a thousand years is the blink of an eye.</p>

<h3><strong>At the Nursing Home</strong></h3>
<p><em>--an old man vacant by the window</em></p>
<p>Hold me occasionally for the light is fading</p>
<p>and I can no longer see the hills that once</p>
<p>rose there, brown hills, sand, sand. I see</p>
<p>the color, like the brown shoulders of a girl</p>
<p>I knew by the lake, outside the window.</p>
<p>Did I marry her? Were there children?</p>
<p>Is that snow? Is it winter already again?</p>
<p>I remember her shoulders, not her face</p>
<p>or name. I remember your face sometimes</p>
<p>(are they your shoulders?) and your touch.</p>
<p>Hold me occasionally. The hills are gone,</p>
<p>and monotony. I know that word, but I</p>
<p>could not say it and no longer even try.</p>
<p>A strange world, monopoly. It tastes like bleach.</p>
<p>My life is there in a thimble on the night stand</p>
<p>only I can see. I stare at it for hours. Hold me</p>
<p>occasionally. There is no hurry. The light fades</p>
<p>slowly. It seems the last part of some other day,</p>
<p>and the thimble holds so little. The hills are gone</p>
<p>and soon the thimble will tip slowly over.</p>
<p>It will make no sound, nothing will spill.</p>

<h3><strong>Inside Apples</strong></h3>
<p>I utter apples, as only I (and you)</p>
<p>can do. A tree can grow an apple.</p>
<p>Pigs with apples know what to do.</p>
<p>But I (and you) can utter "Apples":</p>
<p>"Apples, apples, apples ..."</p>
<p>Red, sour green, yellow delicious,</p>
<p>Macintosh, Winesap, Spys,</p>
<p>Jonathans in pecks and bushels....</p>
<p>Snow white inside, "Apples!"</p>
<p>In wintertime I smell them,</p>
<p>apples in my mind. I pluck</p>
<p>one down. I take a bite, I hear</p>
<p>the crunch, I all but chew.</p>
<p>All, merely murmuring, "Apples."</p>
<p>I marvel at the mystery, this</p>
<p>utterance of apples, here inside</p>
<p>of me (and you). "Apples."</p>

<h3><strong>A Song of Cedars</strong></h3>
<p>I am the singer,</p>
<p>singing of cedars</p>
<p>touching the sky,</p>
<p>but not the song</p>
<p>--the song--</p>
<p>written in me</p>
<p>before I was born,</p>
<p>where the cedars</p>
<p>meet the sky.</p>
