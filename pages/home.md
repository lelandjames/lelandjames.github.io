    <p>Leland James is the winner of the Aesthetica Creative Writing Award and the Conclave Character Prize in fiction. In addition to fiction, Leland has published poetry worldwide, authoring eight poetry collection and five children's books in verse, garnering over a dozen international prizes and awards including nomination for a Pushcart Prize. His writing style is described by Don Williams, Editor Emeritus of New Millennium Writings as "mystical yet earthbound."</p>
    <p>Leland lives in a cabin in the woods in northern Michigan with his wife of over fifty years, his "first reader" and invaluable critic. He cuts his own firewood and shovels a small mountain of snow each year. A champion of both tradition and innovation in the arts, he travels widely to libraries and schools, delivering instructional and entertaining readings of his own and other's creative work. Twain and Dostoevsky are his favorite authors.</p>
