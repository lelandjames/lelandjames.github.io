    <p><em>Longberry’s Leap</em> is the story of a young girl’s adventure into the world of imagination, and her imaginative reconciliation with the uninspired kingdom from where she took <em>the leap</em> and discovered the whimsical world of <em>Out There</em>. Imagination leads to insight as well as delight. The book is suitable read to children as young as six and may be read by many ten- and twelve-year-olds. The book is written in rhyming couplets, with word play enjoyable for both children and adults. The author, Leland James, is an internationally acclaimed poet. It is fully illustrated with whimsical drawings by artist Anne Zimanski. Tools for parents who wish to build their child’s vocabulary through the story are included.</p>
    <p>“Leland James’ storybook for children, Longberry's Leap, is an homage to the thinkers and dreamers out there who can’t accept that everything is already known, and who haven’t lost the capacity for wonder.”</p>
