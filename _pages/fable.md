<h2 style="text-align: center;">ANIMAL LAND</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Prologue</h3>
Animal Land 
was at the heart of things,
of the story as it here unfolds,
a land ringed by many other lands 
in a far away world quite like, 
and quite unlike, our own
imperfect world.

In its makeup
Animal Land resembled 
the other lands in its world,
having seaside, jungle, mountains, 
forest and plains, and a diverse, 
you might say “zoo like,” 
array of inhabitants.

Before the story
begins, let us be clear,
Animal Land was not a land
without its own sins, maybe more
than its share of unholy acts.
But that is another story
for another time.

This is a story 
of Animal Land, and 
thereby its world, in a time
long past when Animal Land and  
stalwart allies bravely opposed
an army of abominable 
aberrant beasts.

A time of World War.
