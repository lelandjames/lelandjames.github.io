  <h2 style="text-align: center;">ANIMAL LAND</h2>
  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Prologue</h3>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: left; display: inline-block;">Animal Land was at the heart of things, of the story as it here unfolds,
    a land ringed by many other lands in a far away world quite like,
    and quite unlike, our own imperfect world.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: left; display: inline-block;">In its makeup Animal Land resembled the other lands in its world,
    having seaside, jungle, mountains, forest and plains, and a diverse,
    you might say “zoo like,” array of inhabitants.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: left; display: inline-block;">Before the story begins, let us be clear, Animal Land was not a land
    without its own sins, maybe more than its share of unholy acts.
    But that is another story for another time.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: left; display: inline-block;">This is a story of Animal Land, and thereby its world, in a time
    long past when Animal Land and stalwart allies bravely opposed
    an army of abominable aberrant beasts.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: left; display: inline-block;">A time of World War.</p>
