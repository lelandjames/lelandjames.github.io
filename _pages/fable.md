  <pre style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; white-space: pre-wrap; border: 0; background-color: transparent; text-align: center; color: black;">
Animal Land was at the heart of things,
of the story as it here unfolds,
a land ringed by many other lands
in a far away world quite like,
and quite unlike, our own imperfect world.

In its makeup Animal Land resembled
the other lands in its world,
having seaside, jungle, mountains,
forest and plains, and a diverse,
you might say "zoo like,"
array of inhabitants.

Before the story begins, let us be clear,
Animal Land was not a land
without its own sins, maybe more
than its share of unholy acts.

This is a story of Animal Land, and thereby its world,
in a time long past when Animal Land and
stalwart allies bravely opposed
an army of abominable aberrant beasts.

A time of World War.
